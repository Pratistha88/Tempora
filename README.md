# Tempora
Tempora is an intelligent climate prediction and agricultural recommendation system that uses advanced numerical methods to forecast weather patterns and recommend suitable crops based on predicted climate conditions.

## 🚀 Features

- **🔮 Climate Prediction**  
  - **Temperature & Rainfall Forecasting:** Predict future climate  
  - **Historical Trend Analysis:** Analyze 20–30 years of climate data to identify patterns  

- **🌾 Agricultural Intelligence**  
  - **Smart Crop Recommendations:** Match predicted climate with optimal crop requirements   
  - **Yield Optimization:** Recommend crops for maximum productivity  

- **⚠️ Risk Management**  
  - **Drought Detection:** Early warning system for drought conditions  
  - **Extreme Weather Alerts:** Predict and alert for severe weather events    

- **🛠️ Data Tools**  
  - **CSV Filter Tool:** Advanced filtering and querying for climate datasets  
  - **Data Preprocessing:** Automated cleaning and preparation of climate data  
  - **Interactive Visualizations:** Dynamic charts and maps for data exploration  

## 📐 Core Techniques Used

- Time-based indexing of monthly climate data
- Forecast modeling using mathematical curve fitting
- Season-aware adjustment using month-wise averages
- Data grouping, aggregation, and custom interpolation
- Manual implementation of numerical algorithms (no external libraries like NumPy for modeling)

## 📝 Usage Instructions

- Open `ClimateAnalysis.ipynb` in Jupyter
- Select a district (e.g., Chitawan)
- Run cells to clean data, interpolate, and forecast climate
- View forecasted trends and get crop recommendation
